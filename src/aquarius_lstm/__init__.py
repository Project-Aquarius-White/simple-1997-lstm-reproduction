Aquarius LSTM 1997 - Faithful reproduction of the original LSTM paper.

This package implements the Long Short-Term Memory architecture exactly as
described in Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), including:

- The Constant Error Carousel (CEC) with weight 1.0 self-connection
- Input and Output gates (no forget gate in the original)
- Truncated backpropagation for O(1) complexity per timestep
- Paper-accurate activation functions g(x) and h(x)

Usage:
    # Tinygrad implementation
    from aquarius_lstm import LSTMCell1997
    
    # PyTorch implementation
    from aquarius_lstm import LSTMCell1997Torch
