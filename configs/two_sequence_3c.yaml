# Sequence parameters (Section 5.3)
# Experiment 3c: T=1000 (maximum tested)
data:
  seq_len: 1000              # Total sequence length
  relevant_len: 3            # First and last 3 elements are relevant
  num_samples: 1024000       # More training for harder variant
  num_test_samples: 10240    # Test sequences
  num_classes: 4             # Classification output

# Training hyperparameters (Section 5.3)
# "learning rate 0.1" for longest sequences
training:
  num_epochs: 1              # Single pass (online learning)
  learning_rate: 0.1         # Lower LR for maximum length
  batch_size: 1              # Online learning

# Network architecture
network:
  input_size: 4              # Input symbol encoding
  hidden_size: 2             # 2 memory cell blocks
  output_size: 4             # 4 output classes

# Weight initialization (Section 5.3)
# "weights in range [-0.1, 0.1]"
initialization:
  init_range: [-0.1, 0.1]

# Gate biases
gate_biases:
  input_gate: -6.0           # Maximum bias for maximum lag
  output_gate: 0.0
