# Temporal Order Problem - 2 Symbols
# Reference: Section 5.6 "Temporal Order" (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
#
# Task: Remember order of symbols X and Y appearing in noise
# Input: Sequence with 2 relevant symbols (X, Y) among distractors (a, b, c, d)
# Output: One of 4 classes based on order (XX, XY, YX, YY)
#
# "The goal is to classify sequences... only X, Y (or, alternatively,
#  B, E) convey relevant information."

# Sequence parameters (Section 5.6)
data:
  seq_len: 100               # Sequence length T (100-110 range used)
  seq_len_range: [100, 110]  # Variable length for robustness
  num_samples: 256000        # Training set size
  num_test_samples: 2560     # Test set size
  num_symbols: 2             # X and Y (2 relevant symbols)
  num_distractors: 4         # a, b, c, d (noise symbols)
  num_classes: 4             # XX, XY, YX, YY

# Training hyperparameters (Section 5.6)
# "learning rate 0.5" for 2-symbol version
training:
  num_epochs: 1              # Single pass (online learning)
  learning_rate: 0.5         # Higher LR for simpler 2-symbol case
  batch_size: 1              # Online learning

# Network architecture
network:
  input_size: 6              # 6 possible input symbols (one-hot)
  hidden_size: 2             # 2 memory cell blocks
  output_size: 4             # 4 output classes

# Weight initialization (Section 5.6)
initialization:
  init_range: [-0.1, 0.1]

# Gate biases (Section 5.6)
# "input gate bias: -2 to -4"
gate_biases:
  input_gate: -2.0           # Moderate bias for 2-symbol case
  output_gate: 0.0
