# Adding Problem - T=100
# Reference: Section 5.4 "Adding Problem" (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
#
# Task: Sum two marked numbers from a sequence of T random numbers
# Input: Two sequences - random numbers in [0,1] and binary markers
# Output: Sum of the two marked numbers (regression)
#
# "The minimal time lag is T/10 time steps. The expected time lag
#  is about T/4 time steps."
