# Temporal Order Problem - 3 Symbols
# Reference: Section 5.6 "Temporal Order" (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
#
# Task: Remember order of 3 symbols appearing in noise
# Input: Sequence with 3 relevant symbols among distractors
# Output: One of 8 classes based on order (all permutations of 3 binary symbols)
#
# Harder variant requiring more memory capacity

experiment:
  name: "temporal_order_3sym"
  task: "temporal_order"

# Sequence parameters (Section 5.6)
data:
  seq_len: 100               # Sequence length T
  seq_len_range: [100, 110]  # Variable length for robustness
  num_samples: 512000        # More samples for harder task
  num_test_samples: 5120     # Test set size
  num_symbols: 3             # 3 relevant symbols (X, Y, Z)
  num_distractors: 4         # a, b, c, d (noise symbols)
  num_classes: 8             # 2^3 = 8 possible orderings

# Training hyperparameters (Section 5.6)
# "learning rate 0.1" for 3-symbol version (harder)
training:
  num_epochs: 1              # Single pass (online learning)
  learning_rate: 0.1         # Lower LR for harder 3-symbol case
  batch_size: 1              # Online learning

# Network architecture
network:
  input_size: 7              # 7 possible input symbols (one-hot)
  hidden_size: 3             # 3 memory cell blocks for 3 symbols
  output_size: 8             # 8 output classes

# Weight initialization (Section 5.6)
initialization:
  init_range: [-0.1, 0.1]

# Gate biases (Section 5.6)
# "input gate bias: -2 to -4" (stronger for 3 symbols)
gate_biases:
  input_gate: -4.0           # Stronger bias for 3-symbol case
  output_gate: 0.0
