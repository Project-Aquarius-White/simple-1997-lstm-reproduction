# Sequence parameters (Section 5.3)
# Experiment 3b: T=500
data:
  seq_len: 500               # Total sequence length

  num_samples: 512000        # Training sequences
  num_test_samples: 5120     # Test sequences
  num_classes: 4             # Classification output

# Training hyperparameters (Section 5.3)
# Adjusted for longer sequences
training:
  num_epochs: 1              # Single pass (online learning)
  learning_rate: 0.5         # Moderate LR for longer sequences
  batch_size: 1              # Online learning

# Network architecture
network:
  input_size: 4              # Input symbol encoding
  hidden_size: 2             # 2 memory cell blocks
  output_size: 4             # 4 output classes

# Weight initialization (Section 5.3)
# "weights in range [-0.1, 0.1]"
initialization:
