# Two-Sequence Problem - Experiment 3a
# Reference: Section 5.3 "Experiment 3" (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
#
# Task: Classify sequences based on two subsequences
# Input: Two relevant subsequences embedded in noise
# Output: Classification based on both subsequences
#
# "The task is to observe and classify sequences of length T...
#  relevant information is conveyed by the first and last 3 elements."
