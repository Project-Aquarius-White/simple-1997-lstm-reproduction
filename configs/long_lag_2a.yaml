# Long Lag Problem - Experiment 2a
# Reference: Section 5.2 "Experiment 2" (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
#
# Task: Reproduce a short sequence after a long delay
# Input: Short pattern followed by distractor sequence
# Output: Reproduce the original pattern
#
# "The task is to observe and then reproduce p+1 randomly chosen elements
#  from {0, 1}... separated by a variable delay."

  num_samples: 256000        # Training sequences
  num_test_samples: 2560     # Test sequences
  distractor_symbols: 4      # Distractor alphabet size

# Training hyperparameters (Section 5.2)
# "learning rate 1.0"
training:
