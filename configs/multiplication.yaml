# Multiplication Problem - T=100
# Reference: Section 5.5 "Multiplication Problem" (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)
#
# Task: Multiply two marked numbers from a sequence
# Input: Two sequences - random numbers in [0,1] and binary markers
# Output: Product of the two marked numbers (regression)
#
# "Harder than the adding problem" due to multiplicative nature
# Requires learning interaction between stored values

experiment:
  name: "multiplication_T100"
  task: "multiplication"

# Sequence parameters (Section 5.5)
data:
  seq_len: 100               # T=100 time steps
  num_samples: 2560000       # Training set size
  num_test_samples: 2560     # Test set size
  min_time_lag: 10           # T/10 = 10 steps minimum lag
  value_range: [0.0, 1.0]    # Random values in [0,1]

# Training hyperparameters (Section 5.5)
# "learning rate 0.1" (lower than adding due to harder task)
training:
  num_epochs: 1              # Single pass (online learning)
  learning_rate: 0.1         # Lower LR for stability
  batch_size: 1              # Online learning

# Network architecture
network:
  input_size: 2              # (value, marker) pairs
  hidden_size: 2             # 2 memory cell blocks
  output_size: 1             # Single product output

# Weight initialization (Section 5.5)
# Same initialization as adding problem
initialization:
  init_range: [-0.1, 0.1]

# Gate biases (Section 5.5)
# Uses same biases as adding T=100
gate_biases:
  input_gate: -3.0           # Same as adding T=100
  output_gate: 0.0
